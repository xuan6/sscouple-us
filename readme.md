##Exploratory analysis
This visualization intends to explore how couples’ sexual orientation, education level, and employment rate would impact their household income. 

At a first glance, same-sex couples usually have better employment status and education attainment than opposite-sex couples. However, male-male couples always enjoy higher income than female-female couples, even though their education and employment status are close or even the same. Also, in the year 2014, the employment and education of the female-female couple are better than those of opposite-sex couples, but the household income of female-female couples becomes slightly lower than that of opposite-sex couples. Accordingly, it looks like that the more males within a couple, the higher the household income. Although many other factors, such as having kids or not, could affect a family’s employment status and household income, the result indicates that males might enjoy advantages at the workplace.
